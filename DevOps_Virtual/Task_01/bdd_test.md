>  Behavior-driven development or BDD is a method for a more accessible and effective way for teams new to agile software delivery that aims at testing human behavior rather than a computer function.

>  Test scenarios in BDD are based on the concept of “given, when, then” to describe various user BDD scenarios. Test cases written so, in simple text, help even non-technical team members to understand what is going on in the software project, with or without a test management tool. A common usage of the BDD approach is with automation using Gherkin and combining it with unit testing

### TEST CASE
- A BDD Test that explain the procedure of the given program.
- This is an automated script that tells a user to write some text into a file, checks the write permission and create a file if file does not exist.
```
  GIVEN: A user to input name of the file
  
  AND: user search for a specific file
  
  WHEN: the file is found, user write to the file
  
  AND: Checks for file write permission 
  
  THEN: If the file is not found, user create a new file.
  
```
